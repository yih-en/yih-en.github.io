Setting up categories on your blog is crucial for navigation. Here are the steps:

1. Set up a new page ```categories.html``` on your home directory of your Jekyll project.
2. Make sure all your posts have the categories field. For example:

{% highlight ruby %}
layout: post
title:  "Override default minima styles by Jekyll"
date:   2018-01-24 13:15:42 +0800
categories: Jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

3. Go to /categories and you will see the page.
